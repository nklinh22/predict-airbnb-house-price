This demonstrates Linear Regression Model to predict Airbnb House price.
It includes calculating MSE (mean squared error) and RMSE (root mean squared error) to evaluate Model accuracy.

-- predict-house-price.ipynb (we train model using the top 75% and test model using the remaining 25%, evaluate model accuracy using RMSE)
